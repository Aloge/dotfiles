# Fasd

[Fasd][1] is a command-line productivity booster, inspired by tools like
[autojump][2], [z][3] and [v][4], it offers quick access to files and
directories by keeping track of files and directories  that were previously
accessed.

For completion to work, this module must be loaded **after** the *completion*
module.
